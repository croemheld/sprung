# Sprung Window Switcher
A windows application to rapidly switch between multiple windows.
Windows are searched by it's window title. The search algorithm is inspired by the command palette from the text editor [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/).
Sprung is intended to be used only with the keyboard. Therefore the UI is deliberately simple.

## Download
